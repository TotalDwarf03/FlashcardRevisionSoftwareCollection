# FlashcardRevisionSoftwareExe
Exported Exe of my Flashcard Revision Software

Inside the frontEnd folder, Run frontEnd.exe.
Because it is an unregistered .exe, most antiviruses will not allow you to run the file.
Please disable your antivirus software when running the application.

If you're using an OS other than Windows, please install the required libraries using PIP. Then Run FrontEnd.py in the source code folder.

Please view the README.md there for more information.
